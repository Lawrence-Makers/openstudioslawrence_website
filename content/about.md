# About Open Studios Lawrence

Open Studios is a program that animates vacant storefronts with practicing local artists, removing barriers for artists while revitalizing neighborhoods.

---

## The Program

Open Studios was founded by Elizabeth Stevenson in Wichita, Kansas, where it has successfully served 100+ artists across 10 locations since its inception. The program creates a simple but powerful arrangement: landlords donate vacant space, artists get free studios, and communities get vibrant neighborhoods.

In Lawrence, Open Studios expands through a partnership that brings proven expertise together with deep local roots.

## Leadership

**Elizabeth Stevenson** — Founder and Director, Open Studios (Wichita and Lawrence)

Elizabeth created Open Studios to address a fundamental problem: vacant storefronts drain neighborhood vitality, and rent is the biggest barrier to artistic practice. Over more than a decade, she has developed and refined the model, creating a structured, professional program that works for landlords, artists, and communities.

She brings to Lawrence a proven track record, established contracts and procedures, and deep understanding of how to match artists with spaces and manage the program for mutual benefit.

## Mission & Values

**Mission:** Open Studios animates vacant spaces with practicing artists, removing barriers to artistic practice while revitalizing neighborhoods and building community.

**Values:**

**Equity** — We believe rent should not be the primary barrier to artistic practice. By removing it, we allow more artists to focus on their work and contribute to their communities.

**Community** — Art thrives in community. We're not building private studios; we're building neighborhood vitality. Artists engage with the public; landlords build community goodwill; neighborhoods gain vibrancy.

**Integrity** — We maintain high standards. Artists are selected by a local committee of professionals. Agreements are clear and fair. The program is structured and professional, not ad-hoc or charitable in tone.

**Practicality** — This works because it benefits everyone. Landlords get animated spaces. Artists get free studios. Communities get vibrant neighborhoods. We're not asking anyone to sacrifice; we're creating genuine alignment of interest.

**Flexibility** — The model adapts. Residencies are typically 3-4 months, but timelines and structures can flex based on space and artist needs. Agreements are straightforward; termination is clear.

**Permanence Through Impermanence** — We succeed when spaces get rented. That's not failure; that's the goal. The temporary nature of residencies is a feature, not a limitation. It keeps the program fresh, supports multiple artists, and ensures success metrics are community-focused, not artist-focused.
