# Animate Your Storefront. Support Local Artists.

Empty storefronts drain the vibrancy from any street. Open Studios fills those gaps with practicing local artists, creating animated, attractive spaces—at no cost to you.

It's simple. Landlords donate rent-free space. Artists get free studios. Our community gets vibrant neighborhoods. Everybody wins.

## How It Works

**For Landlords**: Your vacant space becomes an active, attractive storefront with zero out-of-pocket cost. Insurance and utilities are covered. When the space rents (our goal), you've built community goodwill and demonstrated the space's potential to future tenants.

**For Artists**: Free studio space for 3-4 months. Direct connection to your community. Foot traffic, networking, and the freedom to focus on your practice instead of paying rent.

**For Lawrence**: Neighborhoods that feel alive. Foot traffic that benefits surrounding businesses. An arts scene that attracts regional attention and creative talent.

## Why Open Studios?

**Proven in Wichita.** Open Studios has successfully served over 100 artists across 10 locations in Wichita since its founding. The program has a decade-plus track record of activating vacant spaces and building vibrant communities.

**Led by Elizabeth Stevenson**, founder and director of Open Studios in Wichita, in partnership with **Multistudio** and a local steering committee of artists and faculty from Lawrence Arts Center and the University of Kansas Art Department.

**Not just filling space.** This isn't passive. Artists maintain active studio practices, welcome public visitors during open hours (typically Final Friday of each month), and integrate into the neighborhood—supporting local cafes, shops, and community events.

## What Participating Artists Say

"People are interested in what it is – we have people looking in the window, and when they see the artwork they give us a thumbs-up. It's a chance for those kids to come downtown, because right now there's nothing specifically targeted toward them. It makes downtown more inclusive."

— Ella Baccus, Open Studios artist, Wichita
