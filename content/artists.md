- **Professional approach** — You maintain your space, meet deadlines, communicate clearly
- **Community commitment** — You're willing to engage with the public, support local businesses, participate in events

## How the Residency Works

**Application & Selection**
1. You submit an application with:
   - Images of recent work (5-10 pieces)
   - Short artist statement (200-300 words)
   - Description of your practice (medium, frequency, goals)
   - Why you're interested in Open Studios
   - Any community engagement experience

2. A local selection committee reviews applications:
   - Practicing artists from Lawrence
   - Faculty from Lawrence Arts Center
   - Faculty from University of Kansas Art Department

3. Finalists are interviewed by committee members and potential landlords

4. Selected artists are matched with available spaces

**Before You Move In**
- Sign a straightforward artist agreement (outlines terms, expectations, responsibilities)
- Coordinate studio setup with Open Studios staff
- Attend opening event and community introduction

**During Your Residency (3-4 months)**

Your responsibilities:
- Maintain active studio practice (minimum 10 hours/week onsite)
- Keep space clean and professionally presented
- Host public open hours (typically last Friday of month, 6-9 PM, minimum)
- Welcome visitors and engage with the community
- Support local businesses (cafes, restaurants, shops, bars in the area)
- Participate in community events when possible
- Use social media to promote the space and Open Studios (we provide graphics)
- Maintain professional conduct

Open Studios provides:
- Space (rent-free)
- Liability insurance
- Utilities (if required)
- Promotion and marketing
- Monthly open studio event coordination
- Ongoing support and community connection
- Networking opportunities

**Community Engagement**
This isn't a hidden studio. You're part of the neighborhood. We expect you to:
- Welcome public visitors and engage with them
- Visit neighboring businesses; support the local community
- Participate in Final Friday or other community art events
- Be visible and present as an active community member

**When the Residency Ends**

If your space gets rented (success!):
- You have 30 days to vacate
- Open Studios helps you find your next opportunity—either another Open Studios space (if available) or resources for independent rental
- You remain part of the Open Studios community

If your space remains available:
- You may be invited to extend or transition to a new cohort

Either way, you've had rent-free studio space, community support, and time to focus on your practice.

## What Artists Have Said

"People are interested in what it is – we have people looking in the window, and when they see the artwork they give us a thumbs-up. It's a chance for those kids to come downtown. It makes downtown more inclusive."

— Ella Baccus, Open Studios artist, Wichita (working on public art beautification project with youth)

## Why Open Studios?

**It's real.** This isn't a residency or grant program with abstract goals. It's concrete: free space, community presence, audience engagement.

**It's professional.** Selected by a committee of artists and faculty. Not random. Not charity. Merit-based.

**It's proven.** Open Studios has successfully supported 100+ artists across 10 locations in Wichita. The model works.

**It's community-rooted.** Lawrence Arts Center and KU Art Department are core partners. This program is embedded in our local arts ecosystem.

**It's temporary by design.** You're not committing to a permanent situation. It's a focused residency with clear terms.

**It removes barriers.** Rent is the biggest obstacle to artistic practice. Open Studios removes it, giving you time and resources to focus on your work.
