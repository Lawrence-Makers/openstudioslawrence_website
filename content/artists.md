# Show and Sell Your Work

Lawrence needs to experience your work but studio rent can be an obstacle. **OpenStudios Lawrence** offers free rent to artists so you may share your work with the community.

---

## Do You Qualify?

Any artist with an active artistic practice can qualify, regardless of medium (sculpture, painting, photography, textile, performance, mixed media, graphic design, video, etc.) We'll need to confirm that you will be responsible and maintain the space. To the extent possible we ask that you engage with the public, support local businesses, and participate in local events such as *Final Friday*. We'll confirm with you that you understand this is a temporary residency and you will transition when the space is rented.


We do **not** require professional credentials or degrees, commercial success, an established reputation, or any particular artistic medium or style. If you have a serious practice and a genuine commitment to community engagement we'd love to hear from you.
