## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**What is Open Studios?**
Open Studios is a program that pairs landlords with vacant storefronts with practicing local artists. Landlords donate rent-free space; artists get free studios; communities get vibrant neighborhoods.

**Where does the money come from?**
Open Studios operates on a lean model. Space is donated by landlords. Insurance and utilities are covered through sponsorships, grants, and community support. The program requires no cost from landlords or artists.

**Is this a charity?**
No. It's a structured, professional program with clear benefit for all parties. Landlords get animated spaces. Artists get free studios. Communities get vibrant neighborhoods. It's mutually beneficial, not charitable in tone.

**How long has Open Studios been around?**
Open Studios was founded in Wichita in 2018 by Elizabeth Stevenson. It has successfully served 100+ artists across 10 locations over more than five years. It's now expanding to Lawrence.

### For Landlords

**What does it cost me?**
Nothing. You donate the space. Open Studios covers liability insurance and utilities (if required). You have no financial obligation.

**What if the space gets damaged?**
Open Studios carries comprehensive liability insurance. The artist is required to maintain the space in good condition. If damage occurs due to artist negligence, the insurance and/or artist is responsible.

**What if I need the space back?**
Simple. Your agreement specifies terms and notice period (typically 30-60 days). You can terminate if you have a paying tenant or other needs. Artists understand and accept this.

**Do I have to participate in promotion or community events?**
No. Open Studios handles all promotion, social media, and event coordination. You simply provide the space. We handle everything else. You're welcome to participate, but it's not required.

**How long is the typical residency?**
Usually 3-4 months (one cohort). This can vary based on your needs and artist schedules.

**What if I have specific requirements or restrictions?**
We can discuss. Some restrictions are workable; others might make your space not ideal for the program. Get in touch and we'll talk through it.

**What's the ideal space?**
Ground-level storefronts, 500-2,000 sq ft, with basic utilities and minimal renovation needed. But we're flexible. Have a space? Contact us.

### For Artists

**Is this a professional residency program?**
Yes. You're selected by a committee of artists and faculty from Lawrence Arts Center and KU Art Department. It's merit-based and professional, not ad-hoc. You're supported by a structured program with institutional partnerships.

**How long is the residency?**
Typically 3-4 months. We aim for minimum 4-month commitments when possible to ensure stability and productive practice.

**What if my space gets rented?**
You have 30 days to vacate. Open Studios helps you find your next opportunity—either another Open Studios space (if available) or resources for independent rental. You understood this going in; it's part of the deal.

**Can I extend if the space doesn't rent?**
Possibly. It depends on program scheduling and landlord needs. We'll discuss options when your residency period approaches.

**Do I have to participate in open studio events?**
Yes. Monthly open studio hours (typically last Friday of month, 6-9 PM) are expected. This is part of the community engagement commitment.

**What if I can't meet the 10 hours/week requirement?**
Tell us upfront in your application. Some residencies might not require full-time studio presence. We can discuss your specific situation.

**Do I have to live in Lawrence?**
Not necessarily. You need to be present onsite for your studio practice and community engagement. But many artists live elsewhere and commute. Discuss your situation in your application.

**Can I sell work from my studio?**
Yes. You own your work and can sell directly. Open Studios doesn't take a cut. The focus is on your artistic practice and community engagement, not commercial sales (though that's a nice side benefit).

**What if I need to leave early?**
Discuss with Open Studios. If you need to leave before your residency period ends, we'll work with you to find alternatives or early transition. But this is a commitment; early departure should be rare.

**Do I need a degree or professional credentials?**
No. We're looking for serious artistic practice, not credentials. Hobbyist work or very early-stage practice might not be a fit, but a degree is not required.

### About the Program

**Who selects the artists?**
A local selection committee that includes practicing artists and faculty from Lawrence Arts Center and the University of Kansas Art Department.

**How are artists selected?**
Based on:
- Quality and integrity of artistic practice
- Community engagement commitment
- Professional approach and reliability
- Diversity of mediums and approaches
- Fit with available spaces

**How often are new cohorts?**
Typically every 3-4 months, based on landlord availability and artist applications. Applications are reviewed on a rolling basis.

**Can the same artist have multiple residencies?**
Yes. If you're a good fit and remain interested, you can apply again for a future cohort.

**Does Open Studios provide studio equipment or materials?**
The space is provided. Equipment, materials, and supplies are the artist's responsibility.

**Are there public events?**
Yes. Monthly open studio hours (last Friday of month, typically 6-9 PM) where the public visits studios. Open Studios coordinates these. We may also organize community events, artist talks, or group activities.
