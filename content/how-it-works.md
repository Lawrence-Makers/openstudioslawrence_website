# How Open Studios Works

Open Studios connects landlords with vacant storefronts to practicing local artists who need studio space. It's a straightforward arrangement built on mutual benefit and shared community goals.

---

## The Three-Part Deal

### Landlords Give Space

You donate rent-free use of your vacant storefront for a set period (typically 3-4 months). Open Studios and the artist handle the rest.

**What you get:**
- Liability insurance (covered by Open Studios)
- Utilities (covered by Open Studios, if required)
- An animated, attractive storefront that draws foot traffic
- Social media promotion and community visibility
- Demonstration of your space's potential to future tenants
- Community goodwill and civic recognition
- Zero financial obligation

**What's expected:**
- The space remains available for the artist's active studio practice
- You retain the right to terminate the arrangement if the space is rented (with 30-day notice)
- Standard landlord-tenant maintenance expectations

---

### Artists Get Studios

Selected artists receive free studio space for a residency period (typically 3-4 months). This is real studio space for active artistic practice—not a gallery, not a performance venue, but a working creative space.

**What you get:**
- Free rent (the biggest barrier for many artists)
- Community visibility and foot traffic
- Networking with fellow artists and the Lawrence arts community
- Active support from Open Studios staff and the community
- Opportunity to engage with the public and build an audience
- Eventual opportunity to transition into paid rental space

**What's expected:**
- Maintain active artistic practice (minimum 10 hours/week onsite)
- Keep the space clean and professional
- Welcome public visitors during designated open hours (typically the last Friday of each month, 6-9 PM)
- Participate in community engagement (support local businesses, attend community events)
- Promote Open Studios and the space via social media (with credit)
- Understand the arrangement is temporary: if the space is rented, you have 30 days to vacate
- (Minimum 4-month commitment expected when possible)

## What Makes This Different?

**It's not a charity.** This is a structured program with real benefits for everyone. Landlords get animated spaces. Artists get studio access. Communities get vibrant neighborhoods.

**It's temporary by design.** That's not a flaw—it's a feature. When a space gets rented, that's success. The artist moves on; the landlord wins; the neighborhood is better for it.

**It's curated.** This isn't random. A selection committee of artists and faculty ensures quality artistic practice and community fit.

**It's community-rooted.** Open Studios Lawrence partners with Lawrence Arts Center and the University of Kansas Art Department. This isn't imported from outside; it's adapted for Lawrence by Lawrencians.

**It works.** Wichita's Open Studios has served 100+ artists across 10 locations over more than a decade. The model is proven.

## The Agreement

Both landlords and artists sign straightforward agreements that outline:
- Duration and terms of the residency
- Responsibilities for space maintenance
- Insurance and utility coverage
- Public access hours
- Community engagement expectations
- Termination conditions and notice periods
- Use of photography and promotional materials

All agreements are simple, clear, and designed to protect both parties while keeping the process frictionless.
