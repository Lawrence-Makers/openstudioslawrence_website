# How Open Studios Works

**Open Studios Lawrence** connects landlords in Lawrence, Kansas with vacant storefronts with practicing local artists who need studio space. The program is built on mutual benefit and shared community goals.

---

## A Collaboration Between Landlords and Artists

### Landlords Give Space

Landlords offer rent-free use of their vacant storefront for a set period (typically 3-4 months). Open Studios Lawrence and the artist take care of the rest.

**Benefits to Landlords:**

- Liability insurance provided by Open Studios Lawrence
- Utility expenses, if required, covered by Open Studios Lawrence
- An animated, attractive storefront that draws foot traffic
- Social media promotion and community visibility
- Demonstration of your space's potential to future tenants
- Community goodwill and civic recognition
- No financial obligation

**Expectations from Landlords:**
- The space remains available for the artist's active studio practice
- Landlord may terminate the arrangement if the space is rented given agreed-upon notice (negotiable, typically 30-days)
- Standard landlord-tenant maintenance expectations

### Artists Get Studios

Selected artists or artist organizations receive free studio space for a residency period (typically 3-4 months). This is real studio space for active artistic practice.

**Benefits to Artists:**
- Free rent
- Community visibility and foot traffic
- Networking with fellow artists and the Lawrence arts community
- Support from Open Studios Lawrence and the community
- Opportunity to engage with the public and build an audience
- Opportunity to build relationships with landlords and transition into paid rental space

**Expectations from Artists:**
- Maintain active artistic practice in the space (at least 10 hours/week onsite)
- Keep the space clean and professional
- Welcome public visitors during designated open hours (typically Final Fridays, 6-9 PM)
- Participate in community engagement (support local businesses, attend community events)
- Promote Open Studios Lawrence and the space via social media (with credit)
- Understand the arrangement is temporary: if the space is rented, you will have typically 30 days to vacate.

## Why This Works

**We are not a charity.** This is a structured program with benefits for everyone. Landlords get animated spaces. Artists get studio access. Lawrence gets activated areas.

**We offer temporary space by design.** When a space gets rented, we've succeeded. The artist moves on, the landlord wins, and the community is better for it.

**Everything is curated.** Open Studios Lawrence's selection committee of artists and faculty ensures quality artistic practice and community fit.

**Our model has already succeeded.** Wichita's Open Studios has served more than 100 artists across 10 locations over more than a decade.

## The Agreement

Both landlords and artists sign straightforward agreements that outline:
- Duration and terms of the residency
- Responsibilities for space maintenance
- Insurance and utility coverage
- Public access hours
- Community engagement expectations
- Termination conditions and notice periods
- Use of photography and promotional materials

All agreements are designed to protect both parties while keeping the process as frictionless as possible.
