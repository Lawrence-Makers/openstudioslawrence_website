### For Artists

**Is this a professional residency program?**
Yes. You're selected by a committee of local artists, faculty and staff from Lawrence Arts Center and KU Art Department. It's merit-based and professional, not ad-hoc. You're supported by a structured program with institutional partnerships.

**How long is the residency?**
Typically 3-4 months.

**What if my space gets rented?**
You typically have 30 days to vacate. Open Studios Lawrence helps you find your next opportunity, either another Open Studios Lawrence space (if available) or resources for independent rental.

**Can I extend if the space doesn't rent?**
Possibly. It depends on program scheduling and landlord needs. We'll discuss options when your residency period approaches.

You are expected to participate in Final Fridays as part of your community engagement commitment.

**What if I can't meet the 10 hours/week requirement?**
Tell us upfront and we can discuss your specific situation.

**Can I sell work from my studio?**
Yes. You own your work and can sell directly if you wish. Open Studios Lawrence doesn't take a cut.

**What if I need to leave early?**
If you need to leave before your residency period ends, we'll work with you to find alternatives or early transition. But this is a commitment and early departure should be rare.

**Do I need a degree or professional credentials?**
No. We're looking for serious artistic practice, not credentials.

**What happens to artwork if I leave it behind?**
Per the agreement, you must remove all artwork and materials by the termination date. Anything left is considered an unrestricted gift to the landlord.
