# Animate Your Vacant Space

Potential tenants struggle to envision their business in a dusty, inactive window. OpenStudios Lawrence can help.

By participating in OpenStudios Lawrence, your storefront will become more attractive. An artist will draw foot traffic and public attention to your space. You will gain community visibility as your space is promoted on social media and through press coverage.

Our ultimate goal is to see your space rented by a permanent tenant, and when that happens you can easily terminate your agreement. Throughout the process you'll be supporting local arts and culture in Lawrence. It costs you nothing,

## Summary of the Process

**1. Offer your space**:
Fill out the contact form below.

**2. OpenStudios Lawrence will vet and match**:
We handle artist selection through our local selection committee. Qualified artists must have serious artistic practices, be committed to community engagement, and show a willingness to  maintain the space. We then present the artist to you for final approval if you wish.

**3. OpenStudios Lawrence takes care of everything else**:
We will handle all contracts and legal agreements, liability insurance, and cost of utilities if required. We'll promote the artist in your space through social media and facilitate monthly public events.
