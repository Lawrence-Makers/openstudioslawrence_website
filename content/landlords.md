# For Landlords: Animate Your Vacant Space

You have space that's been sitting empty. It's costing you in market perception, missed opportunity, and neighborhood vitality. Open Studios can change that—at no cost to you.

---

## The Landlord Value Proposition

Empty storefronts hurt your building's market appeal. Even when space gets rented, potential tenants struggle to envision a business in a dusty, inactive window. Open Studios fixes that.

**What you invest:** Nothing. No rent, no money, no out-of-pocket cost.

**What you get:**
- **Animated, attractive storefront** — Active artists drawing foot traffic and public attention
- **Zero cost** — Open Studios covers liability insurance and utilities (if required)
- **Community visibility** — Social media promotion and press coverage
- **Market demonstration** — Future tenants see a vibrant, active space instead of an empty one
- **Flexibility** — Simple agreement, easy to terminate if space is rented
- **Goodwill** — Support for local arts and culture; community recognition

**Timeline:** Typically 3-4 months per artist. When the space is rented, we transition to the next artist or return the space to you.

## How It Works for You

**1. You Offer Space**
Contact Open Studios with information about your vacant storefront:
- Location and square footage
- Condition and basic amenities (utilities, restrooms, parking)
- Duration you're willing to participate (flexible)
- Any restrictions or requirements

**2. We Vet and Match**
We handle artist selection through our local selection committee (Lawrence Arts Center and KU Art Department faculty). We present qualified, professional artists who:
- Have serious artistic practices
- Are committed to community engagement
- Will maintain the space professionally
- Will draw foot traffic and public interest

You have final approval on the artist match.

**3. We Handle Everything Else**
- All contracts and legal agreements
- Liability insurance
- Utilities (if required)
- Community promotion and social media
- Monthly open studio events
- Public engagement and foot traffic
- Space management and support

You simply provide the space. We handle the rest.

**4. The Residency**
Typically 3-4 months. The artist:
- Maintains active studio practice
- Hosts public open hours (typically final Friday of month, 6-9 PM)
- Keeps the space clean and professional
- Becomes part of the neighborhood

You benefit from:
- Active foot traffic and community energy
- Visibility and social media promotion
- Demonstrated market potential of the space
- Community goodwill

**5. When Space is Rented**
If a tenant rents your space (our goal), the artist vacates with 30-day notice. Open Studios helps transition the artist to another space. You get a fully activated storefront that's now proven its market value.

## Real Benefits, Real Examples

**Wichita Success**
Open Studios in Wichita has activated 10 locations and served 100+ artists. Landlords who participated report:
- Increased foot traffic to their buildings
- Improved street-level appeal and curb appeal
- Successful rental of previously difficult-to-let spaces
- Positive community relationship and civic goodwill

One participant in Wichita noted: "The curb appeal of these spaces is really enhanced when the windows have nice graphics on them, and there's energy and activity in the space." (Ty Tabing, Chicago Loop Alliance, who consulted on Wichita's program)

**Why It Works**
Empty spaces devalue neighborhoods. Active spaces activate neighborhoods. When people see art, activity, and creative energy, they notice—and they visit. Visitors spend money. Neighborhoods thrive. Tenants want to be there.
